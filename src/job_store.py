         sent, so an acked job can never be lost by a crash. Duplicate
         deliveries (server replay) are detected here by job_id.
      2. ``mark_outcome()`` when the job finished but the outcome could not be
         reported to the server (offline) — re-reported on reconnect.
      3. ``remove()`` once the outcome has been reported successfully.
